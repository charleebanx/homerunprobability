# Homerun Probability Model

Python program that predicts homerun probabilities using advanced baseball metrics. Utilized Python for data processing, calculations, and Excel scraping via Python libraries (pandas and openpxyl).

Need to install HR_Model 1, ballpark_info, and player_info for the full code to run. The ballpark and player info are imported to the main code (HR_Model 1)
